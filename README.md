# GrinPy
*A NetworkX extension for calculating graph invariants.*

### What is it?
GrinPy is still in development. We have released version 0.1 which includes
several well-known graph invariants. However, the algorithms used to calculate
NP-hard invariants are simple brute force. We will be updating these to more
efficient algorithms over the next several months in our build-up to version
1.0. The `master` branch is the latest version and now includes more invariants
than version 0.1

NP-hard invariants in the latest version include:

* Independence number
* Domination number
* Power domination number
* Total domination number
* Connected domination number
* Independent domination number
* Zero forcing number
* Total zero forcing number
* Connected zero forcing number
* Matching number
* Minimum maximal matching number
* Generalized *k* versions of almost all of the above invariants

Other invariants included are:

* Residue
* Slater number
* Sub-domination number
* Annihilation number

In addition to the graph invariants listed above, we have now included some
simple checks for structural properties of a graph:

* `is_triangle_free`
* `is_bull_free`
* `is_claw_free`

### How do I use it?
Full documentation is available at [https://grinpy.rtfd.io](https://grinpy.rtfd.io). Here is a sample of how to
calculate the independence number:
```python
>>> import grinpy as gp
>>> G = gp.petersen_graph()
>>> gp.independence_number(G)
4
```

GrinPy automatically imports [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) and provides all of the NetworkX classes and methods in the same interface.

### Why does it exist?
The motivation for this project is to filter a database of graphs into an ordered tree of subsets. This database will be used in an experimental automated
conjecturing program. In creating the required packages for this database, we
realized that a Python package for calculating graph invariants would be
useful for professional research and for graph theory education.
